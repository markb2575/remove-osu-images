# remove-osu-images
Replaces images from osu! with an image of your choice!

**Steps**
1. Run driver.py
2. Select osu! directory
3. Press confirm

**Warning**
  * This permanently removes all images (to my knowledge)

**Note**
  * To customize the images replace StockImage1.png and StockImage2.png
  * StockImage2.png must be of the size 160 x 120 to fit properly in the thumbnail of the beatmap
